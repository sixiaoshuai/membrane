CHANGELOG:

matlab30211.tar.bz2:

 first version.


matlab30425.tar.bz2:

 version as used for gamm 2003
 some modifications to mlin, flowback


matlab30623.tar.bz2:

 ps.m, Ts.m, dpsdT.m: range of validity corrected
 psnew.m added: ps from Perry (1997)
 version as used for publication ijts03; figs. 3 -- 10


matlab40113.tar.bz2:

 capillary pressure added
 pcap.m new.
 flowback.m: pcap added at evap. front
   possibility of meniscus added
   warning 'calculating film thickness...': values added
 intp.m: pcap added at termination condition
 mback: TolX to mguess/1e4
 version as used for extended summary ICTAM04


matlab40718.tar.bz2

 new directory: membrane,
   contains membrane material properties: costheta.m, curv.m, epsilon.m, k.m
 pcap, mmod.m removed
 new files: costheta.m, curv, dpkdT, dsigdT, epsilon.m, join, kelv.m, rkelv
 todo created
 flowstruct: lin.p6 and lin.T4 removed
 pTplot moved to obsolete
 resplot.m: q made dimensionless with m*cp*Delta T, latent heat subtracted
 mback.m: modified to account for costheta<0 and for multiple solutions
 flowback: possibility for liquid film - vapor added
 join: utility to join two flowstructs
 kelv.m: vapor pressure reduction, pk/ps
 dpkdT: derivative of vapor pressure at a curved interface
 pcap removed, use curv*sig(T) instead
 rkelv: evaporation enthalpy at a curved interface
 sig: interpolation replace by polynomial
 dsigdT: derivative of sig

 An intermediate save of a version that accounts for capillary pressure,
 but not for vapor pressure reduction or changes in the evaporation
 enthaly.
 Works, but fails to find a solution in small range of kappa>kappac, if
 a finite capillary pressure with a wetting liquid is assumed.
 

matlab40910.tar.bz2

 new files: Tk.m, mkelv.m
 serious errors for wetting liquid remain! (Jump in pressure from
 saturation pressure to pressure in equilibrium at a curved interface.)
 See also previous version.
 version as used for proceeding stamm04


matlab50421.tar.bz2

 new files:  properties.m, mcuss.m, munsat.m, substance.m, map.m
 new directories:  membrane, nitrogen
 matlab versions now stored in marchiv

 properties.m:  prints the actual material properties
 substance.m:  returns string of the name of the fluid substance
 mcuss.m:  calculates the mass flow according to one case of an isothermal
  description (Sidhu & Cussler, J. Membr. Sci., 2001)
 munsat.m:  calculates the mass flow for one case of unsaturated vapor
  upstream of the membrane
 mkelv.m:  corrected, now the linear description correctly accounts for
  capillary condensation
 map.m:  print the flow map
 iso.m:  calculation of mass flow for Schneider's (1983) example

 version used for Prag, 11.04.2005


matlab80403.tar.bz2

 version just for backup
 curv.m:  radius korrigiert (Faktor 2)
